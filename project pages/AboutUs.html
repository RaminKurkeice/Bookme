		<h3><center>Mission Statement</center></h3>
		</br>
		<p>Our goal is to provide students with the option for cheaper used textbooks and having the platform to sell their textbooks</p>
		<p>for higher returns than college bookstores. We strive for students to have the freedom to buy and sell their used textbooks</p>
		<p>without the fear of overpaying for educational institutions hand me downs!</p>
	</br>

		<h3><center>Who Are We?</center></h3>
		</br>
		<p>We are students from Humber college, we know firsthand how expensive textbooks are and how unsatifying the returns are. </p>
		<p>So we decided to make Bookme for students like us, like you. need a textbook search if someone is selling it for cheaper here,</p>
		<p>or have something worth to sell? Then create a posting just follow the format and we will host it no problem.</p>
